# Connor Bell's CV

This is my CV, written in LaTeX. Each release of this CV is versioned, so please ensure you have the latest copy.

## Recruiters

I expressly do not allow recruiters to edit my CV, as many times I have noticed they misrepresent my skills or lie about my experience. If you are looking to hire me and have a copy of a CV from a recruiter that does _not_ match the style or content of the CV available here, please disregard their copy and inform them that they are misrepresenting me, and I do not accept that.

## Download

The latest copy of my CV can be downloaded in PDF format from [here](https://github.com/Makeshift/CV/releases/download/latest/Connor.Bell.CV.pdf).

## Website

My website can be found [here](https://connor-bell.com). It is intentionally barebones, but contains links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and other contact information. It also contains a small amount of information regarding what I'm looking for in a company.
